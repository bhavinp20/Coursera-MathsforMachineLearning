Statistics of Datasets

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most important dimensionality reduction algorithms in machine learning. 
In this course, we lay the mathematical foundations to derive and understand PCA from a geometric point of view. In this 
module, we learn how to summarize datasets (e.g., images) using basic statistics, such as the mean and the variance. We 
also look at properties of the mean and the variance when we shift or scale the original data set. We will provide 
mathematical intuition as well as the skills to derive the results. We will also implement our results in code (jupyter 
notebooks), which will allow us to practice our mathematical understand to compute averages of image data sets.
